It is best to install the support libraries in a virtual environment

***
e.g.

python3 -m venv venv-flask-3.7.3

pip3 install flask

pip3 install requests


There are two unit test programs in `test` package

* BlockChainTest.py - test the basic classes
* DistributedBlockChainTest.py - Depends on having 2 servers running on ports 9000 and 7575
